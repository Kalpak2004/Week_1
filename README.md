# Week_1
The AICTE Edunet Shell Skills4Future Internship is a prestigious 4-week online program that aims to equip students with essential technological and professional skills for a sustainable future. Organized by the (AICTE) in collaboration with Shell and the Edunet Foundation.


# 💧 Water Quality Prediction

## 📘 Project Overview  
This project, developed as part of the AICTE-Edunet Shell Skills4Future Internship, uses data-driven techniques to assess and predict the quality of water sources. With increasing concerns over access to clean and safe water, this solution aims to support smarter decision-making in water management through Artificial Intelligence.

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Predict water potability based on physical and chemical parameters  
- Identify key factors influencing water quality  
- Demonstrate AI’s potential in tackling environmental sustainability challenges  
- Gain hands-on experience with machine learning and data visualization tools

## 🧰 Technologies Used  
- Python (pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn)  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Git & GitHub  

## 🧪 Methodology  
1. **Data Cleaning** – Handled missing/null values and outliers  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis** – Visualized relationships between features  
3. **Model Building** – Trained several ML models (Random Forest, Logistic Regression)  
4. **Model Evaluation** – Compared accuracy, precision, recall to select the best performing model  
5. **Visualization** – Created interactive dashboards in Power BI

## 🌱 Impact  
This project supports Sustainable Development Goal 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation) by promoting AI-powered approaches for water safety analysis. It can help organizations and governments monitor water sources more efficiently and act faster in response to contamination risks.

## 📌 Learnings & Outcomes  
- Gained practical experience in machine learning and data analytics  
- Learned to communicate insights using dashboards  
- Understood the real-world implications of AI for environmental solutions

## 🏁 Acknowledgments
